## Overview

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The project is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), a React-based web framework, and it showcases my skills, projects, and experiences in a visually appealing manner. This is a pixel-perfect migration from the original Flutter implementation, maintaining the same design, functionality, and user experience.

## Live Demo

Check out the live version of my portfolio at [mxdhavgautam.com](https://mxdhavgautam.com/).

## Features

- Clean and responsive design.
- Easy to understand code.
- Pixel-perfect parity with the original Flutter implementation.
- Optimized performance with Next.js App Router.
- Dark/Light theme support.
- SEO optimized.

## Installation and Usage

(You need to have Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn/pnpm installed to run this project locally.)

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mxdhavgautam/portfolio-src.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd portfolio-src`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` (or `yarn install` or `pnpm install`)
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev` (or `yarn dev` or `pnpm dev`)
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

## Web Build

To build the production version of the website, use:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
```

This creates an optimized production build with static files in the `out/` folder. The built static files can be copied to your deployment repository (see `deploy.sh` script for automated deployment).

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
# or
pnpm start
```
